# ws-kevinharper
Code repository for My personal web site [kevinharper.com](https://kevinharper.com/).

## About the Site
New version of my personal web site.

Previous version, which is now archived, has been up for nearly 18 months. It's time for a new look and use.

### Purpose
I plan to use the site to showcase personal projects and open source contributions.

The initial structure will feature 4 pages: main, experience, links, contact.

I would like to include a blog section and integrate a personal url shortener.

### Needs
High accessibility:
* Function on all devices
* Adhere to Progressive Enhancement design philosophy

CI/CD
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Circle CI

Modern Web Framework
* Django >3.0
* Python 3.8

Automated upgrades (PyUp)
* Self-auditing software
* Self-updating software

## Contribute
This is a personal project but open to pull requests.

I invite you to [create a new issue](https://github.com/khdc-me/ws-kevinharper/issues) or submit a Pull Request if you find errors in code, security, and or spelling/grammar.
